This is a Code Quiz which tests  user's knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts.

The quiz is a multiple-choice and has a timer which determines at the end  how well user answered the questions.

The timer starts when user pushes "Start" button.
If answer is wrong -  application code extracts 10 seconds from total time.
Also, at the end of quiz user will be prompted for initials.They needed to store scores in local storage, which can be accessed by clicking a link.

Here some screenshots that will help understand the flow
